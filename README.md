A simple FastAPI application with WebSocket and Redis support.

# Install Dependencies
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

# Run Redis in Docker
```docker run --name redis-server -p 6379:6379 redis```


# Make sure Docker is running and port 6379 is not already in use.

# Run FastAPI Application
```uvicorn main:app --reload```


# After starting, the server will be available at:
```http://localhost:8000/docs```

# Test WebSocket Connection

# Open your browser console (F12 → Console) and paste the following code:

```const s = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8000/ws");```
```s.onmessage = e => console.log("MSG:", e.data);```


Once connected, you’ll see messages coming from the server.
